The Weaverland Conference songbook

This is the Old Order Mennonite Weaverland Conference songbook.

Copyed from the front of the songbook.

Mennonite Hymns-The need for English among Mennonites became first apperent in Virginia in the early 1800's when finally
the Virginia Conference appointed a committee to collect and choose suitable hymns. They were Joseph Funk, Joseph Wenger
and David Hartman. Their collection was finally published mostly in this form in 1847 in Harrisonburg, Virginia.
This collection grew and was published by the church at large through fourteen editions, the last one being in 1893,
when many churches took interest in other hymnals, especially the 𝘊𝘩𝘶𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘺 𝘚𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘰𝘭 𝘏𝘺𝘮𝘯𝘢𝘭 of 1902.
 It was around this time the the Old Order Mennonites began taking interest in this English Virginia hymnal, and finally
in 1932 the Weaverland Conference reproduced the hymnal. by 2002 they had taken it through sixteen more editions.
 Now in AD 2006 the above-mentioned conference is taking it though a thirty-first edition of 10,000 copies. Over the many
printings many typing errors have crept in, so that numerous corrections have been made, but we tried to keep them totally
compatible with the older books. The book has been retypeset in an effort to make clearer and larger print. It is our 
Sincere hope that these enlarged and improved books can be of better service in worship.   --June 1, 2006
