        <span>Our hope for years to come;</span><br>
        Our shelter from the stormy blast,<br>
        <span>And our eternal home!</span><br>
        <br>
        Beneath the shadow of Thy throne<br>
        <span>Thy saints have dwelt secure;</span><br>
        Sufficient is Thy arm alone,<br>

        From everlasting Thou art God,<br>

        Thy Word commands our flesh to dust,<br>

        A thousand ages in Thy sight<br>

        <br>
        The busy tribes of flesh and blood,<br>
        <span>With all their lives and cares,</span><br>
        Are carried downwards by the flood,<br>
        <span>And lost in following years.</span><br>
        <br>
        Time, like an ever-rolling stream,<br>
        <span>Bears all its sons away;</span><br>
        They fly, forgotten as a dream<br>
        <span>Dies at the opening day.</span><br>
        <br>
        Like flow'ry fields the nations stand,<br>
        <span>Pleased with the morning light;</span><br>
        Tho flow'rs beneath the mower's hand<br>
        <span>Lie withered ere 'tis night.</span><br>
        <br>
        O God, our help in ages past,<br>

        I give my mortal interest up,<br>

        Still, still unchanging, watch beside<br>
        <span>My painful bed--for Thou hast died;</span><br>

        <br>
        These are the foll'wers of the Lamb;<br>
        <span>From tribulation great they came;</span><br>
