        (O happy morn! illustrious hour!)<br>

        <span>From creatures, earth and dust,</span><br>
        They make our expectations vain,<br>
        <span>And disappoint our trust.</span><br>
        <br>
        Now I forbid my carnal hope,<br>

        I give my mortal interest up,<br>
        <span>And make my God my all.</span><br>

        <span>In mercy oft are sent;</span><br>
        They stopped the prodigal's career,<br>
        <span>And caused him to repent.</span><br>
        <br>
        Although he no relentings felt,<br>
        <span>Till he had spent his store,</span><br>
        His stubborn heart began to melt,<br>
        <span>When famine pinched him sore.</span><br>
        <br>
        "What have I gained by sin," he said,<br>
        <span>"But hunger, shame, and fear?</span><br>
        My father's house abounds with bread,<br>
        <span>While I am starving here.</span><br>
        <br>
        "I'll go and tell him all I've done,<br>
        <span>Fall down before his face;</span><br>
        Unworthy to be called his son,<br>
        <span>I'll seek a servant's place."</span><br>
        <br>
        His father saw him coming back,<br>
        <span>He saw and ran and smiled;</span><br>
        Then threw his arms around the neck<br>
        <span>Of his rebellious child.</span><br>
        <br>
        "Father, I've sinned, but O forgive,"<br>
        <span>"Enough," the father said,</span><br>
        "Rejoice, my house, my son's alive,<br>
        <span>For whom I mourned as dead.</span><br>
        <br>
        "Now let the fatted calf be slain,<br>
        <span>Go, spread the news around,</span><br>
        My son was dead, but lives again--<br>
        <span>Was lost but now is found."</span><br>
        <br>
        'Tis thus the Lord His love reveals,<br>
        <span>To call poor sinners home;</span><br>
        More then a father's love He feels,<br>
        <span>And welcome all that come.</span><br>

        <br>
        Though He was Lord and Master great,<br>
        <span>Who giveth all commands,</span><br>
        He washed His own disciples' feet,<br>
        <span>With His own blessed hands.</span><br>
        <br>
        When thus their Master with them dealt,<br>
        <span>And proved His love to them,</span><br>
        How must their drooping hearts have felt,<br>

        <br>
        May they who worldy honor seek,<br>

        Like Jesus, humble, truly meek,<br>
        <span>From self-applauses free.</span><br>
        <br>
        Such facts as these should have effect,<br>
        <span>To bring the haughty low;</span><br>
        The proudest heart should feel a check,<br>
        <span>And deeply humbled, too.</span><br>
        <br>
        Thus Peter's mind was much impressed,<br>
        <span>He thought himself too mean;</span><br>

        <span>To have no part with Him.</span><br>
        <br>
        "Till thou art washed, thou hast no part<br>
        <span>With me," the Saviour said;</span><br>

        <br>
        There the Lord's Supper was prepared,<br>
        <span>And Christ the Lord had with them shared,</span><br>
        Of which th' apostles did partake:<br>
        <span>He thus an ordinance did make.</span><br>
        <br>
        He rose and laid His garments by,<br>

        To prove His love divinely sweet,<br>

        <b>T</b>here is a fountain filled with blood,<br>
        <span>Drawn from Immanuel's veins;</span><br>
        And sinners plunged beneath that flood,<br>
        <span>Lose all their guilty stains.</span><br>
        <br>
        The dying thief rejoiced to see<br>
        <span>That fountain in his day:</span><br>
        And there may I, though vile as he,<br>
        <span>Wash all my sins away.</span><br>
        <br>
        Thou dying Lamb! Thy precious blood<br>
        <span>Shall never lose its power,</span><br>
        Till all the ransomed Church of God<br>
        <span>Are saved to sin no more.</span><br>
        <br>
        E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream<br>
        <span>Thy flowing wounds supply,</span><br>
        Redeeming love has been my theme<br>
        <span>And shall be till I die</span><br>
        <br>
        Then in a nobler, sweeter song,<br>
        <span>I'll sing thy power to save,</span><br>
        When this poor, lisping, stamm'ring tongue<br>
        <span>Lies silent in the grave.</span><br><br>
